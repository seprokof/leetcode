# 3070. Count Submatrices with Top-Left Element and Sum Less Than k
You are given a **0-indexed** integer matrix `grid` and an integer `k`.

Return *the* **number** *of submatrices* (a submatrix `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` is a matrix that forms by choosing all cells `matrix[x][y]` where `x1 <= x <= x2` and `y1 <= y <= y2`) *that contain the top-left element of the* `grid`*, and have a sum less than or equal to* `k`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[7,6,3],[6,6,1]], k = 18
Output: 4
Explanation: There are only 4 submatrices, shown in the image above, 
that contain the top-left element of grid, and have a sum less than 
or equal to 18.
```

**Example 2:**

![Ooops](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/01/01/example21.png)
```
Input: grid = [[7,2,9],[1,5,0],[2,6,6]], k = 20
Output: 6
Explanation: There are only 6 submatrices, shown in the image above, 
that contain the top-left element of grid, and have a sum less than 
or equal to 20.
```

**Constraints:**
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 1000`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000`
- `1 <= k <= 10^9`
